sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: It was slower than selection sort in the random and the reversed database, however it even faster than merge sort in the sorted case

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: It was the fastest program, even at the largest input it only took less than a second to run, and the smaller cases were also faster

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: It didn't matter if it was sorted, reversed or random, the algorithm was taking about the same time to do the task and was slow with the largest inputs (about 4 seconds)
